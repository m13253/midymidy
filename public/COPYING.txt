Why not GPL?
------------

This project has switched to be partly closed source and the GPL license does
not apply any more.

I am really sorry about this, but we have to close the source and work on it to
build better website.

We need to pay for our server and everything else needed to run the site. So
MidyMidy will be commercial. Perhaps

We are still developing our software, but this repo is not being updated for a
while.
